Rather than leave students to\n          learn these skills on their own, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking\n          attempts to bridge the gap between traditional computer science\n          coursework and the industry recruiting process. With mock interviews\n          and practice problems curated by frequency, Introduction to\n          Algorithmic Thinking provides a hands on and practical approach to\n          learning how to code algorithms commonly seen in software engineering\n          interviews.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            Become well-versed in common data structures and popular problem\n            solving methods\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Develop algorithmic intuition that will help you approach new\n            problems\n          </li>\n          <li>Learn how to communicate your thought process effectively</li>\n          <li>\n            Prepare students for the upcoming internship and full time SWE\n            recruiting season\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n        <p> </p>\n\n        <h3>Homework</h3>\n        <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"homework\" />\n        <p>\n          Weekly homework will be assigned and submitted on bCourses. For\n          leetcode problems, this includes submitting screenshot verification\n          that you have <i>attempted</i> the problem. Some homework assignments\n          may have you answer a question with a short paragraph. 7 out of 10\n          homeworks are required.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The weekly homework assignments will be one of the important parts of\n          this class. If you successfully work through and understand the\n          solution to every problem, you will be ready for any coding interview.\n          Only attempts are required to complete the homework and pass, because\n          we encourage you to struggle with the problems for a bit before\n          looking at the answer. We will host office hours (Time: TBD) so you\n          get a chance to talk to us about the problems.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Grading Breakdown</h3>\n        <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"gradeBreak\" />\n        <ul>\n          <li>Lecture Attendance: 20%</li>\n          <li>Mock Interview Participation: 40% </li>\n          <li>Homework Assignments: 40%</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h3>Grading Policy</h3>\n        <p>\n          <b>Attendance</b>: Three unexcused absences from our lecture are\n          allowed. For a class to be excused, you must get advanced permission\n          (just email us we’re nice!). Missing more than 3 unexcused classes\n          will result in an automatic No Pass (NP). Please reach out to us if\n          you have any questions or concerns.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Participation</b>: Participation enhances intuition, and we aim to\n          build an algorithmic intuition so that if you were presented with any\n          coding problem you could do it! As interviewing is an interpersonal\n          skill, in-class participation is a major aspect of the course\n          (especially in the mock interviews). Participation is demonstrated by\n          engaging actively in your mock interview and lecture attendance. We\n          will make you fill out feedback forms periodically about your mock\n          interview partner to judge participation. As long as you participate\n          in the breakout rooms, you’ll receive full points.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <b>Homework</b>: Weekly homework will be assigned and submitted on\n          bCourses.
