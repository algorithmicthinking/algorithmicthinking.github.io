      content="Coding interviews often require a skill set that is not fully covered by the undergraduate CS curriculum. Rather than leave students to learn these skills on their own, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking attempts to bridge the gap between traditional computer science coursework and the industry recruiting process. With mock interviews and practice problems curated by frequency, Introduction to Algorithmic Thinking provides a hands on and practical approach to learning how to code algorithms commonly seen in software engineering interviews."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
